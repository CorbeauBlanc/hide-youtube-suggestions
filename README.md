# hide-youtube-suggestions
Custom style to use with Stylus that hides the video suggestions and cards on youtube

[UPDATE 22/10/2025]: Updated for the new layout + fixed the chapter selection bug. Changed the option for a checkbox instead, the default behaviour is now to completely hide the side panel.

[UPDATE 26/05/2025]: Added a checkbox for the suggestions at the end of the video and a checkbox to disable the end screen cards (suggested video or channel).

[UPDTAE 10/04/2024]: Now works with the shitty new interface.

[UPDATE 01/08/2024]: Now in the style's options you can choose if you want to simply move the right side suggestions out of sight (the default value) or entierly remove them.
